This archive contains the NEURON files from the paper: 

Computational modeling of the effects of amyloid-beta on release
probability at hippocampal synapses.
Armando Romani, Cristina Marchetti, Daniela Bianchi, Xavier Leinekugel,
Panayiota Poirazi, Michele Migliore and Hélène Marie 
Front. Comput. Neurosci. (2013); doi: 10.3389/fncom.2013.00001 

The CA1 pyramidal model is from Bianchi et al. (2012), with the
kinetic scheme introduced by Tsodyks et al. (1998) to model changes in
release probability and synaptic integration.

Usage: Auto-launch from ModelDB or download and extract this archive,
compile the mod files (mknrndll in mswin and mac OS X, nrnivmodl in
unix/linux) in the experiment folder and use nrngui to start the
simulation.hoc file in the "experiment" directory.  Once started press
the "Run" button in the presented dialog box to reproduce the ctrl
results in Figure 2 of the paper:

To reproduce Abeta results, set the variable U= 0.36 in the panel and
click 'Run'. You should see a graph like this:
